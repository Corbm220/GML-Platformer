***Notes***: 

* The environment was set up using GMS version 2022.9.1.51. 
* I take no credit for the assets or the concepts.
* All I have provided are the assets from the tutorial and the preferences for GML code (not visual).
* My goal is to provide a template that a student can clone to follow along with Shaun and practice using Source Control Management along the way.

## Credits
The assets and video tutorials were created by [Shaun Spalding](https://www.youtube.com/c/ShaunSpalding).
Check out Shaun's amazing collections of videos.

Megan to Mr Winneka:
This is me editing the ReadMe file to say what mechanics and features I used. I watched videos 1 and 2, plus a video on movement between rooms. I did everything in the videos, plus added 2 extra rooms and features to send the player back to the first room in they fall out of the frame.
